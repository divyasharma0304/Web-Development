                    <p>
                        We at Himalya Quartz are committed to safeguarding all our customers and their individual interests. We aim at providing only the best Crystals, Gemstones, and Quartz items to our customers at decent prices according to the customer’s needs. We endeavor to educate and create awareness about these naturally occurring unique creations of stones and crystals. The quartz items, healing stones, and other precious crystals that we provide are nature’s precious Gifts, formed over millions of years. This is what makes them so special, valuable, and sometimes expensive. Other than their unmatchable Beauty and explicit Aura, Indian Vedic Astrology also vouches for their mystical powers that bind the people even more strongly to our Hindu culture. But, due to the immense popularity of Natural Gemstones and their increased demand, there are a lot of look-alikes of Natural Gemstones, Synthetic and Treated stones in the market. Most people tend to buy only Natural Gemstones and unfortunately, due to lack of knowledge and appropriate information, they end up buying synthetic or treated gemstones. Nevertheless, Our only aim at Himalya Quartz is to help our modern customers find the perfect pick for themselves. For that, we promise to deliver the hundred percent natural and exotic gems at your fingertips, the ones that you want.                    </p>

                        <p>Having been in the business for so many years, Himalya Quartz takes the stringent process in the <b>selectivity, storage, and distribution</b> of its gemstone collection to ensure they are natural, unheated, and untreated gemstones with A-one quality. We ensure that our services are fair in trading and thus provide complete transparency on prices.

                            <br /><br />Today the market, especially the online platforms are flooded with Synthetics, Simulants, Lookalikes which are Treated Gemstones. Most of these are treated with Color & Clarity Enhancement to improve their outer appearance and are not at all authentic, yet are sold at higher market prices. This is what sets Himalya Quartz apart from the others. We promise products that are <b>genuine, natural, reliable, and durable in every possible aspect</b>. Apart from this, we have introduced the Video-Conferencing option, which allows our customers to select and choose their most wished stones through online mode. 
                            
                            <br /><br />We are not at all involved in the Market supply system which attributes to the fact that we directly mine from the valleys and sell the desired products to our customers directly. Thus, there are no middlemen in the process and hence the customer gets <b>gemstones</b> at the most cost-effective price. 
                            
                            <br /><br />We do not restrict our customers from anything and offer them real-time visibility of their order status right from the order placement to manufacturing, packaging, and dispatch. </p>
